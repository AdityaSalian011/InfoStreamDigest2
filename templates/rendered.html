What’s missing from the story is the concrete measures those governments could take to stop the slaughter in Gaza, as well as their complicity by continuing to supply weapons to Israel.

How Palantir got techno-militiarism trending

Silicon Valley CEOs are increasingly making the case that their technologies can transform the way that wars are fought. And of all the companies involved in this military-tech boom, one stands out: Palantir.

Branding itself as America First, the data analytics firm has won billions of dollars in contracts and makes no apologies for the need to kill people – if that’s what it takes to protect Western interests.

          <div class="section-content" style="white-space: pre-line;">The Brewers need one win over the Reds or a Phillies loss to the Twins to secure the #1 seed in the National League. Although this weekend isn’t a meaningless series for the Brew Crew, they’re far more concerned about shaping plans for the Division Series that’ll begin eight days from now.

That includes using Jacob Misiorowski out of the bullpen in preparation for his expected postseason role. The 23-year-old will make his first career relief appearance behind lefty Robert Gasser tomorrow (link via Adam McCalvy of MLB.com). Gasser will likely be limited to 3-4 innings as he continues building back from last year’s elbow surgery. Misiorowski should work multiple innings out of the ’pen.

The rookie righty was so electric over his first few appearances that he was named to the All-Star Game five starts into his career. He has a 5.45 earned run average in the second half. Misiorowski has only gone beyond five innings once over his past nine times out. He has very little experience turning a lineup over more than twice. Milwaukee prefers to let him max out over shorter stints in high-leverage situations in October.

Milwaukee’s bullpen should get another big boost this weekend. Closer Trevor Megill is expected back from the 15-day injured list on Sunday, reports Curt Hogg of The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. The Brewers will probably get him into that game regardless of the score to ensure he gets on the mound before the start of the postseason. Megill, who has 30 saves with a 2.54 ERA, has missed the past month with a forearm strain. Skipper Pat Murphy has since used a committee approach in the ninth inning. Abner Uribe, Jared Koenig and Aaron Ashby have each recorded saves in Megill’s absence.

Jose Quintana won’t pitch this weekend but also seems to be trending towards a return in the Division Series. The veteran starter tossed three innings in a live batting practice session this afternoon (via the MLB.com injury tracker). Quintana has been down since the middle of September with a strained left calf.

If he’s healthy, Quintana could line up to start Game 3 of the NLDS. Milwaukee will very likely go with Freddy Peralta and Quinn Priester in the first two contests. Brandon Woodruff hasn’t officially been ruled out for the Division Series, but that’d require him returning from a lat strain after a minimal stint. If Woodruff can’t make it back, Quintana and rookie righty Chad Patrick would presumably be the options to take the ball in the third game. Murphy wouldn’t wait long to get into a deep bullpen in that one.</div>

Week 4 of the 2025 NFL season is here, and our NFL analysts have you covered in the eleventh hour. Don't miss our last-minute prep for a loaded slate.

First, analytics writer Seth Walder breaks down three stat trends that could be pivotal this weekend. Then fantasy football writer Eric Moody runs through five players who are rostered in under 50% of ESPN fantasy football leagues as of Saturday and could be started in a jam. That's followed by NFL analyst Matt Bowen predicting three potentially big surprises and sports betting analyst Pamela Maldonado giving her favorite bet for Week 4.

Will Bears receivers DJ Moore and Rome Odunze put up big numbers? Could Texans edge rushers Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter get after Cam Ward? Which two quarterbacks might be good fantasy sleepers? And should we expect the Chargers to not only win but also cover against the Giants in quarterback Jaxson Dart's debut? Let's dive in.

Potential surprises | Best bet

Walder: Three key stat trends that could determine Week 4 winners

Are edge rushers Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter in for a huge day against the Titans?

In short: Oh yes. The Texans rank third in pass rush win rate this season (49%), while the Titans are below average in pass block win rate (57%). Star rushers Anderson and Hunter both rank in the top 10 in pass rush win rate at edge and each have multiple sacks on the season, despite the fact that Houston is winless. And critically, rookie quarterback Cam Ward is taking sacks at a massive 13% rate -- third-most this season and higher than any QBR-qualified quarterback last season.

It's easier to get sacks when leading, and we certainly should expect that to be the case Sunday. My sack model gives Anderson (59%) and Hunter (57%) strong chances to record at least one sack. No other pass rusher is over 52%. Each player has a 22% chance to record two sacks or more, too.

Could Bears wide receiver DJ Moore get going against the Raiders?

ESPN's receiver scores returned this week, and Moore was surprisingly the No. 1 player. It was a surprise considering Moore's start to the season has been relatively pedestrian: 12 receptions for 135 yards and a touchdown. But the open score indicates Moore (and perhaps the scheme) has been doing its job, so there could be a whole lot more yards in his future.

The spike could start as soon as this week. Though Moore moves around in his alignment, he plays as an outside receiver on the left side more than anywhere else. That should match him up against Raiders cornerback Kyu Blu Kelly, who has allowed 1.5 yards per coverage snap, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. That is not only much higher than average for an outside corner, but it's also the highest among Raiders defenders with at least 75 coverage snaps this season.

Who will win a strength vs. strength matchup on the ground in the Eagles-Buccaneers game?

The whole world knows the Eagles like to run the ball and do it well. They have the third-lowest pass rate over expectation (per NFL Next Gen Stats) this season and rank first in EPA per designed carry. But the Buccaneers are a particularly stiff challenge on that front, as they rank first in defensive EPA per designed carry.

Tampa Bay's three opponents have averaged minus-0.03 EPA per play when playing other teams this season, but minus-0.30 against the Buccaneers. Philadelphia's most common run type is outside zone (44%), and the Bucs have proven adept at stopping it, allowing just 2.4 yards per carry to opponents running outside zone this season.

Whichever team's strength wins out Sunday will have the upper hand in this matchup.

Moody: Five fantasy sleepers you need to pick up -- and can start this week

Matthew Stafford, QB, Los Angeles Rams (39.1% rostered)

Stafford doesn't offer much rushing upside, but he throws to one of the league's best wide receiver tandems in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. He gets a favorable home matchup against a Colts defense, too. The Rams' offensive line should provide solid protection against a Colts front that ranks 29th in pass rush win rate. Establishing the run could set Stafford up to capitalize through the air, especially with Indianapolis missing cornerback Kenny Moore II.

play 1:45 Should the Rams be encouraged despite loss to Eagles? Rex Ryan explains why the Rams proved they are among the best teams in the NFL even with a loss to the Eagles.

Romeo Doubs, WR, Green Bay Packers (34.9% rostered)

I wrote about Doubs here last week, but he had a disappointing performance against the Browns with 4.5 fantasy points. Still, Week 4 presents a great opportunity, as the Cowboys' defense has allowed the most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. With Jayden Reed out and tight end Tucker Kraft playing through a knee injury, Doubs should see heavy involvement.

Woody Marks, RB, Houston Texans (26.2% rostered)

Marks' role has grown in the each of the past two games with the Texans' offense. While Nick Chubb leads their backfield in touches, Marks is averaging more yards per carry (4.6) than Chubb (3.9). The rookie's high-level traits give him an edge behind a Houston offensive line that ranks just 21st in run block win rate, and he faces a Titans defense that has allowed the third-most fantasy points per game to running backs. This could be the week Marks breaks out.

Geno Smith, QB, Las Vegas Raiders (20.6% rostered)

Smith is coming off a 26-point fantasy performance against the Commanders. The Raiders lean heavily on the vertical passing game, and a significant portion of his production has come on deep throws. He now faces a banged-up Bears secondary that has allowed the third-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks (behind only the Dolphins and Cowboys). Smith is well-positioned to keep producing with playmakers such as Brock Bowers, Jakobi Meyers and Tre Tucker at his disposal.

Chig Okonkwo, TE, Tennessee Titans (18.5% rostered)

Okonkwo had nine receptions for 101 yards over the past two weeks and just led the Titans with 66 yards in Week 3. With 16 targets through three games and growing chemistry with rookie QB Cam Ward, he's trending up. The Texans have been tough on tight ends, but they did allow nine receptions to the position last week against the Jaguars, giving Okonkwo a clear path to volume.

Bowen: Don't be surprised if ...

Broncos QB Bo Nix throws an interception against the Bengals

Nix has thrown at least one interception in two games this season, and the tape shows some areas of concern. He currently has an off-target rate of 20.8%, which ranks 25th in the league, and he has been late on throws outside the numbers. Plus, his footwork looks rushed, and that could lead to even more ball location issues. The Bengals have four interceptions through three weeks, and I see them getting another one on Monday night.

Bears WR Rome Odunze gets back into the end zone against the Raiders

In each game this season, Odunze has seen seven or more targets and caught at least one touchdown. The emerging No.1 receiver for quarterback Caleb Williams, Odunze gets a Raiders defense that's allowing 237 passing yards per game (24th in the league).

Look for Bears coach Ben Johnson to isolate Odunze on vertical throws, and set him up in the low red zone.

Packers WR Matthew Golden sets a career high against the Cowboys

The rookie has caught just six of eight targets over his first three games, but he had four receptions and 52 yards against the Browns' top-tier defense in Week 3. Against a Dallas unit that's lacking impact players and is currently allowing a league-worst 288 passing yards per game, look for Golden to create explosive plays and finish with over 70 receiving yards. The Packers should have answers for a Cowboys defense that plays the most zone coverage in the NFL (87% of opponent dropbacks).

Maldonado: My favorite bet for Week 4

Los Angeles Chargers -6.5 at New York Giants

I'm still licking my wounds from the Rams +3.5 that I went with last week. But this week, rookie Jaxson Dart is a wild card in his first start. He's mobile, creative and the kind of rookie who can make something happen when the play breaks down. But debuts are rarely smooth, and this is a brutal draw.

Through three weeks, the Chargers have allowed just 5.5 yards per pass and the lowest completion rate on deep throws in the league. They're disciplined on the back end and stingy inside the 20-yard line, giving up touchdowns on only a quarter of opponent red-zone trips. L.A. quarterback Justin Herbert, meanwhile, should have a clean pocket all afternoon. The Giants lead the NFL in blitz attempts (50), but they rarely get home. And Herbert is excellent against the blitz, averaging 10.2 yards per attempt.

The QB experience gap, plus a red zone and third-down edge that tilt heavily to Los Angeles, make this a strong spot for the Chargers to cover.</div>

President Donald Trump announced a barrage of new tariffs on Thursday, aimed at pharmaceuticals, heavy trucks and home furnishings in particular, to shore up domestic industry in these sectors, and protect American manufacturers from “unfair outside competition.”

Large Scale ‘Flooding’ of Products Into The U.S.

The administration announced a 100% tariff on all imported branded or patented pharmaceuticals, which can be waived for those companies that have already begun constructing manufacturing plants in the United States.

Trump said the move is intended to reshore critical drug production and reduce the industry and the country’s dependency on foreign suppliers, according to a Reuters report.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Additionally, imported heavy-duty trucks and kitchen cabinets will be subject to a tariff of 25% and 50%, respectively, with an additional 50% levy on bathroom vanities and a 30% tax on upholstered furniture, effective next week. All tariff measures are set to take effect on October 1.

“The reason for this is the large-scale ‘FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

Donald Trump Truth Socialbr /



Trump framed the tariff on trucks as a national security imperative, saying, “We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!”

He also cited the move as a boost for companies like PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ: PCAR), which owns Peterbilt and Kenworth, as well as Daimler Truck Holding AG’s (OTC: DTRUY).

Industry Groups Push Back

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposed the truck tariffs, saying that the top five import sources for the industry are Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, and Finland, all of which are “allies or close partners of the United States,” and thus, pose “no threat to U.S. national security.”

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America has similarly come out against the new tariffs on drugs, saying that of the $85.6 billion in ingredients used in medicines consumed in the U.S., 53% was manufactured domestically, with the rest coming from Europe and other allies.

The bill includes a deduction of $6,000 for individuals ($12,000 for couples) over 65, and is intended to reduce taxation on Social Security benefits. However, many will still be taxed on their benefits once they begin collecting.

Fidelity offered advice on saving on your Social Security taxes. Here’s what you need to know.

Taxation of Social Security Benefits

Up to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxed, depending on your household income, according to Fidelity. If your income is more than $34,000 for an individual or $44,000 for a couple, up to 85% of your benefits are taxable. If your income is between $25,000 and $34,000 for an individual or between $32,000 and $44,000 for a couple, up to 50% of your benefits are taxable. If your income is less than $25,000 for an individual or $34,000 for a couple, your benefits will not be taxed.

Other Tax Considerations in Retirement

In addition to taxation on your Social Security benefits, it’s important to remember that distributions (withdrawals) from traditional (not Roth) IRA and 401(k) accounts are taxable as regular income. So, when you calculate your income to determine your tax bracket, be sure to include those amounts, as well.

Dividends or gains from the sale of stock that you have held for a year or longer are taxed at 15% or 20%, depending on your filing status and income.

Distributions from Roth IRAs or 401(k)s and health savings accounts (HSAs) are not taxed. These accounts are funded with after-tax money, so you don’t pay taxes on withdrawals. This money is also not taken into account when determining whether your Social Security income will be taxed.

How To Pay Less in Taxes on Your Social Security Benefits

There are a couple of tactics you can use to help pay less in taxes on your Social Security retirement benefits. Even if you’re not collecting Social Security yet, knowing these tips can help you in the future.

Roth IRAs and 401(k)s

If you are still saving for retirement, contribute to a Roth IRA or 401(k) if you can, either instead of or in addition to your traditional retirement contributions. There are income limitations for Roth contributions, but if your income exceeds those, you may still be able to reap some benefit. You can convert your traditional IRA or 401(k) savings to a Roth. You’ll have to pay taxes on the money you convert now, but you won’t pay taxes on that money when you withdraw it. And that can reduce the amount of income you have, which informs the calculation of how much of your Social Security benefit is taxed.</div>

          <div class="section-content" style="white-space: pre-line;">What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Three-A Resources Berhad (KLSE:3A) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.

We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Three-A Resources Berhad:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.093 = RM47m ÷ (RM540m - RM30m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).

Therefore, Three-A Resources Berhad has an ROCE of 9.3%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Food industry average of 9.7%.

If you'd like to look at how Three-A Resources Berhad has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of Three-A Resources Berhad's past earnings, revenue and cash flow.

The Trend Of ROCE

The returns on capital haven't changed much for Three-A Resources Berhad in recent years. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 9.3% and the business has deployed 31% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.

The Bottom Line On Three-A Resources Berhad's ROCE

In summary, Three-A Resources Berhad has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. And with the stock having returned a mere 11% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.</div>

Buying a home for a college student at 23 of 121 universities it surveyed was cheaper than paying for room and board, according to the Mortgage Research Network.

The results don't align perfectly with geography or population. Colleges in Chicago, Milwaukee and Cincinnati show modest gains for homeowners, along with southern colleges in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Hattiesburg, Mississippi and Columbia, South Carolina. But room and board win out in other urban environments, especially on the super-expensive West Coast.

For example, students at the University of Washington-Seattle would lose out when buying a home, paying about $83,000 more than room and board over three years. Sky-high home prices are to blame for the uneven calculations, matching similarly negative results at the University of Colorado-Boulder, University of California-San Diego and New York University.

Don't Miss:

The report goes a step further, calculating additional cost savings in home ownership beyond a typical three- or four-year college education. For example, it says three-year savings at Temple is nearly $30,000 but the homeowner can reap up to a $70,000 profit buying and holding the property for at least 10 years.

Where is the cheapest place to buy your college kid a home? Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia wins the award with the lowest average home price of $137,909. Mom and dad could come out nearly $19,000 ahead over three years in this deal, according to the survey. Even better, the property could save over $33,000 if held for 10 or more years.

The University of Delaware, University of Alabama and University of Memphis in Tennessee round out the top five schools where it's better to own a home than pay room and board. West Coast and Rocky Mountain cities listed above make the bottom five, along with California State University-Fullerton in Orange County and Montclair State University in New Jersey.

Terran Fielder, media specialist at EarthDay.org, said weekends at thrift stores are crowded, which can cut down on selection. “On weekends, there tends to be a rush of shoppers, likely because most people are off work,” Fielder said. “Stores are more packed, and everyone is vying for the same stuff.”

Fielder added that weekends are when people drop donations off. Though that does increase inventory, those items likely won’t be available to purchase. “People mainly drop off their donations on the weekend, but these stores don’t have the staff to get that new stock out on the shelves that day,” she said.

Times To Avoid

Kelly Handley is the founder at Ultimate Thrifting, and said what time you decide to go thrifting can have a huge impact on the items you encounter. “New inventory typically goes out in the morning, and if you’re there when the store opens, you’ll have the best pick,” she explained. “By late afternoon, stores are generally too picked over to discover great finds.”

Holidays To Avoid

Last minute gift hunting is popular at thrift stores, and that’s why thrifting and shopping expert PJ Gach recommended avoiding Christmas Eve at the thrift store. “If you must go shopping in a thrift store on Christmas Eve, you will be walking into a free-for-all: items flung over racks, a few tug-of-wars between shoppers fighting over a sweater or coat, or even a fistfight or two.”

Additionally, if you’re looking for a Halloween costume day of, Gach said you might find a house of horrors at your local thrift store. “Second only to Christmas Eve, shopping at a thrift store near Halloween can be a literal nightmare,” Gach pointed out. “Inside, you’re surrounded by people who are so intent on finding the ‘perfect Halloween costume’ that common sense and courtesy have jumped out the window and are running for their lives. These people are so desperate to create an ‘award-winning’ costume that they’ll snatch items out of people’s hands, baskets and carts.”

Don’t Lose Out on Deals

Dr. Marcia Layton Turner, an eBay top-rated seller, added that another disadvantage of going on weekends is since there are already lots of customers, there tend to be fewer deals. “As someone who regularly shops at thrift stores, I know that the best and worst days to shop will depend on when the local stores have discount days,” she said. “I avoid shopping on Saturdays because there are no special deals and the stores are always very crowded.”
